# java-simple_synth

## Usage (GUI):
* javac Keyboard2.java
* java Keyboard2
* Remember to type "e " or hit "End chord" after each chord. 

### Usage (bonus command line!):
* javac Audio.java
* java Audio.java
* Follow instructions.

## Info:
* Simple (and clunky!) synth using StdAudio.java.
* Check out the demo video at **demo/demo.mp4**!
* Can loop chords, arpeggiate them, change play time, and more! Only 6 max notes per chord I think. 
* Written after one semester of java.
* The stop looping button doesn't work. And after you hit "Loop your chords" you can not change.
* It appears Java changed the definition of a class I used, SwingWorker, so I now had to make slight code changes to get that to work (pun intended). On the bright side, now you can end the program without going to task manager :P previously the moment you hit play, the program would become unresponsive.
* The code is absolutely terrible. But considering I had only done programming for a semester, I'd say not bad.
